- The two bilingual groups are essentially equivalent regarding proficiency and use
- Stress matters: Monolinguals always predict, bilinguals do to some degree, but depends on stress (holding use and proficiency constant)
  - HL: 
    - 👍🏽Paroxytone (CANta) (most common)
    - 👎🏽Oxytone (canTA) (less common)
  - L2: 
    - 👎🏻Paroxytone (CANta) (most common)
    - 👍🏻Oxytone (canTA) (less common)
- Group differences
  - Monolingual time course different from both bilingual groups (they predict sooner) regardless of stress
  - HL and L2ers are essentially the same with paroxytonic stress
  - L2ers predict more than HL with (less common) oxytonic stress pattern (but still not a lot)
- Proficiency, use, and prediction
  - Marginalizing over stress,
