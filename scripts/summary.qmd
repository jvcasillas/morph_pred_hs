## Take-aways

- The two bilingual groups are essentially equivalent regarding proficiency and use.
- Stress matters: Monolinguals always predict, bilinguals do to some degree, but depends on stress (holding use and proficiency constant)
  - HL: 
    - üëçüèΩParoxytone (CANta) (most common)
    - üëéüèΩOxytone (canTA) (less common)
  - L2: 
    - üëçüèªParoxytone (CANta) (most common)
    - üëçüèªOxytone (canTA) (less common)
- Group differences
  - Monolingual time course different from both bilingual groups (they predict sooner) regardless of stress
  - HL and L2ers have essentially the same time course with paroxytonic stress, but L2 course is slightly delayed in comparison, the opposite is true for oxytonic stress, i.e., the HL time course is slightly delayed
  - L2ers predict more than HL with (less common) oxytonic stress pattern (but still not a lot)
- Proficiency, use, and prediction
  - HL
    - High use individuals always predict in paroxytone condition. 
    - As use decreases, so does prediction
    - Marginalizing over stress, prediction is pretty good across the board
    - For oxytonic stress condition, only high use/high prof individuals predict
    - Unexplained weirdness... in oxytone condition low prof/low use predicts higher (not sure about this)
  - L2
    - Generally use is less important
    - Higher proficiency associated with higher prediction
    - Lowest overall prediction in paroxytone condition
