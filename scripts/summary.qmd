# Take-aways

- The two bilingual groups are essentially equivalent regarding proficiency and use.
- Stress matters: Monolinguals always predict, bilinguals do to some degree, but depends on stress (holding use and proficiency constant)
  - HL: 
    - Paroxytone (CANta) (most common): `r yes_no(T)`
    - Oxytone (canTA) (less common): `r yes_no(F)`
  - L2: 
    - Paroxytone (CANta) (most common): `r yes_no(T)`
    - Oxytone (canTA) (less common): `r yes_no(T)`
- Group differences
  - Monolingual time course different from both bilingual groups (they predict sooner) regardless of stress
  - HL and L2ers have essentially the same time course with paroxytonic stress, but L2 course is slightly delayed in comparison, the opposite is true for oxytonic stress, i.e., the HL time course is slightly delayed
  - L2ers predict more than HL with (less common) oxytonic stress pattern (but still not a lot)
- Proficiency, use, and prediction
  - HL
    - High use individuals always predict in paroxytone condition. 
    - As use decreases, so does prediction
    - Marginalizing over stress, prediction is pretty good across the board
    - For oxytonic stress condition, only high use/high prof individuals predict
    - Unexplained weirdness... in oxytone condition low prof/low use predicts higher (not sure about this)
  - L2
    - Generally use is less important
    - Higher proficiency associated with higher prediction
    - Lowest overall prediction in paroxytone condition

# Write-up

## Method

### Lexical stress

Lexical stress (henceforth stress) refers to the relative prominence of one syllable with regard to the others in a given word. 
Stress is lexically encoded and contrastive in Spanish ('término' [ˈteɾ.mi.no], Eng. *term*; 'termino' [teɾ.ˈmi.no], Eng. *I finish*; 'terminó' [teɾ.mi.ˈno], Eng. *(s)he finished*) and in English ('produce' [ˈpɹo.duːs] noun, 'produce' [pɹə.ˈduːs] verb), though it is more productive in the former than in the latter. 
To wit, few stress minimal pairs exist in English that are not semantically related [See @cutler2012native]. 
The primary acoustic correlates of stress are F0, duration, and intensity, though their relative cue-weighting is language-specific [See @gordon2017acoustic; @chrabaszcz2014acoustic; @holt2006cue, among many others]. 
Despite native English speakers' familiarity with stress, they typically have trouble producing [@bullock2003analogy; @lord2007role] and perceiving [@face2000role; @face2005syllable; @face2006cognitive; @ortega2013english; @saalfeld2012teaching] stress differences in L2 Spanish. 
A possible explanation might be found in language-specific isochrony [@pike1945intonation]. 
Whereas English is often described as a 'stress-timed' language, i.e., one with relatively constant intervals between stressed syllables, Spanish is typically described as 'syllable-timed', i.e., each syllable is perceived as having the same duration. 
Differences such as these may shape how stress is perceived in each language. 
In English, for example, unstressed vowel reduction---often present in stress-timed languages---may be sufficient for indicating stress [@cutler2012native; @tremblay2018functional], rendering other cues relatively less important for speech perception. 
As a consequence, native English speakers may have to adjust their cue-weighting strategies when learning Spanish, a language that does not have vowel reduction. 
Evidence from cross-modal priming studies indeed suggests that stress is processed differently by native listeners in both languages during lexical access [See @soto2001segmental; @cooper2002constraints]. 
The extant literature suggests that native listeners are tuned in to the relevant acoustic cues of their language and take advantage of them to increase processing efficiency. 
Unsurprisingly, they use the same cue-weighting strategies when learning an L2, often resulting in difficulties during the early stages of acquisition [@ingvalson2012can; @iverson2003perceptual]. 

### Participants

We included data from `r subject_stuff$n_final` individuals for analysis. 
There were `r pull_from_tib(subject_stuff$n_group, group, "Monolingual", n)` monolingual participants, `r pull_from_tib(subject_stuff$n_group, group, "HL", n)` heritage speakers, and `r pull_from_tib(subject_stuff$n_group, group, "L2", n)` adult L2 learners. 

The bilingual participants completed language *use* and *proficiency* assessments. 
We fit the *use* and *proficiency* data to separate Bayesian linear models to assess potential group differences. 
In both cases, the response variable, *use* or *proficiency* score, was a proportion. 
Thus, we used the beta distribution for the model likelihood with a logit linking function. 
The models included regularizing, weakly informative priors.^[See [Proficiency/use cleaup and EDA](https://www.jvcasillas.com/morph_pred_hs/scripts/02_eda_prof_use.html) for full details.] 
We compare the posterior marginal mean difference between groups on both response variables. 
We established a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) of ±0.1. 
If, for a given measure, the full range of the 95% highest density credible interval (HDI) of the difference estimate falls within the ROPE, we consider there to be compelling evidence that the groups are equivalent. 
The HL group had an average proficiency score of `r pull_from_tib(prof_use_desc, Group, "HL", Proficiency_prose)` compared to the L2 groups' score of `r pull_from_tib(prof_use_desc, Group, "L2", Proficiency_prose)`. 
The marginal mean difference was `r pull_from_tib(prof_use_mod, Metric, "Proficiency", Estimate)` and all of the HDI fell within the ROPE. 
The probability that the effect was positive was `r pull_from_tib(prof_use_mod, Metric, "Proficiency", PD)`. 
Regarding language use, the HL group had an average score of `r pull_from_tib(prof_use_desc, Group, "HL", Use_prose)` compared to the L2 groups' score of `r pull_from_tib(prof_use_desc, Group, "L2", Use_prose)`. 
The marginal mean difference was `r pull_from_tib(prof_use_mod, Metric, "Use", Estimate)` and, again, all of the HDI fell within the ROPE. 
The probability that the effect was negative was `r pull_from_tib(prof_use_mod, Metric, "Use", PD)`. 
Taken together, we are confident that the groups do not differ in any meaningful way with regard to use of/proficiency in Spanish.
@tbl-prof-use-desc provides descriptive statistics and summarizes the models. 


```{r}
#| label: tbl-prof-use-desc
#| tbl-cap: "Language use and proficiency assessments for the heritage and L2 bilingual groups. The table reports the mean and standard deviation, as well as posterior estimates of the marginal mean difference (L2 - HL) and the 95% highest denisty credible interval (in brackets). The proportion of the posterior density falling within the region of practical equivalence (±0.1) is reported in the ROPE column. The probability that the effect is of the median's sign is reported in the PD column."

### Statistical analyses

As alluded to above, we use Bayesian Data Analysis for all statistical inferences.^[See supplementary materials for more information.] 
In what follows, we present three primary analyses. 
First, we analyze the time course data focusing on group differences in varying stress environments. 
Next, we examine target fixations at the onset of the target syllable. 
The purpose of this analysis is to determine (1) whether participants predict target suffixes before they are presented auditorily, (2) the rate at which prediction occurs, and (3) how prediction is modulated by proficiency and use.
