'termino' [teɾ.ˈmi.no], Eng. *I finish*; 'terminó' [teɾ.mi.ˈno], Eng. *(s)he finished*) and in English ('produce' [ˈpɹo.duːs] noun, 'produce' [pɹə.ˈduːs] verb), though it is more productive in the former than in the latter. \nTo wit, few stress minimal pairs exist in English that are not semantically related [See @cutler2012native]. \nThe primary acoustic correlates of stress are $f_{0}$, duration, and intensity, though their relative cue-weighting is language-specific [See @chrabaszcz2014acoustic; @gordon2017acoustic; @holt2006cue, among many others]. \nDespite native English speakers' familiarity with stress, they typically have trouble producing [@bullock2003analogy; @lord2007role] and perceiving [@face2000role; @face2005syllable; @face2006cognitive; @ortega2013english; @saalfeld2012teaching] stress differences in L2 Spanish. \nA possible explanation might be found in language-specific isochrony [@pike1945intonation]. \nWhereas English is often described as a 'stress-timed' language, i.e., one with relatively constant intervals between stressed syllables, Spanish is typically described as 'syllable-timed', i.e., each syllable is perceived as having the same duration. \nDifferences such as these may shape how stress is perceived in each language. \nIn English, for example, unstressed vowel reduction---often present in stress-timed languages---may be sufficient for indicating stress [@cutler2012native; @tremblay2018functional], rendering other cues relatively less important for speech perception. \nAs a consequence, native English speakers may have to adjust their cue-weighting strategies when learning Spanish, a language that does not have vowel reduction. \nEvidence from cross-modal priming studies indeed suggests that stress is processed differently by native listeners in both languages during lexical access [See @cooper2002constraints; @soto2001segmental]. \nThe extant literature suggests that native listeners are tuned in to the relevant acoustic cues of their language and take advantage of them to increase processing efficiency. \nUnsurprisingly, they use the same cue-weighting strategies when learning an L2, often resulting in difficulties during the early stages of acquisition [@ingvalson2012can; @iverson2003perceptual]. \nWith regard to prediction, there is evidence that monolingual Spanish speakers use lexical stress to predict a word's suffix (AUTHORS) and that highly skilled late bilinguals can also learn this skill (AUTHORS). \nIt is not clear how unique language experience, e.g., heritage speakers, language proficiency and language use modulate spoken word prediction. \n\n<!--\n  About 80% of all stressed words have penultimate stress (Quilis 1993: 403) and more than 95% of all nouns, adjectives, and adverbs follow the unmarked patterns (Morales-Front 1999: 211)\n\n-->\n\n# Method\n\n## Participants\n\nWe collected data from 122 individuals for analysis. \nThere were 30 monolingual participants,  heritage speakers, and 50 adult L2 learners. \nThe bilingual participants completed language *use* and *proficiency* assessments. \nWe fit the *use* and *proficiency* data to separate Bayesian linear models to assess potential group differences.^[In both cases, the response variable, *use* or *proficiency* score, was a proportion. \nThus, we used the beta distribution for the model likelihood with a logit linking function. \nThe models included regularizing, weakly informative priors. \nSee @sec-prof-use-supp of the supplementary materials for full details.] \nWe compare the posterior marginal mean difference between groups on both response variables. \nWe established a region of practical equivalence (ROPE) of ±0.1. \nIf, for a given measure, the full range of the 95% highest density credible interval (HDI) of the difference estimate falls within the ROPE, we consider there to be compelling evidence that the groups are equivalent. \nThe HL group had an average proficiency score of 0.70 (SD = 0.09) compared to the L2 groups' score of 0.71 (SD = 0.14). \nThe marginal mean difference was 0.02 [−0.03, 0.07] and all of the HDI fell within the ROPE. \nThe probability that the effect was positive was 0.77. \nRegarding language use, the HL group had an average score of 0.41 (SD = 0.15) compared to the L2 groups' score of 0.38 (SD = 0.16). \nThe marginal mean difference was −0.02 [−0.09, 0.05] and, again, all of the HDI fell within the ROPE. \nThe probability that the effect was negative was 0.72. \nTaken together, we are confident that the groups do not differ in any meaningful way with regard to use of/proficiency in Spanish.\n@tbl-prof-use-desc provides descriptive statistics and summarizes the models. \n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-prof-use-desc .cell tbl-cap='Language use and proficiency assessments for the heritage and L2 bilingual groups.

For non-standardized values @kruschke2018rejecting recommends using the following formula: $ROPE = \\frac{\\mu_1 - \\mu_2}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_1^2 + \\sigma_2^2}{2}}}$\n\n\n\n\n{{< pagebreak >}}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## GAMMs {#sec-gamms-supp}\n\nIn this section we provide additional information regarding the GAMMs reported in manuscript. \nFor clarity, we divide this section into two subsections, @sec-all-groups-gamm deals with the model including monolinguals, and @sec-bi-groups-gamm details the model examining only the bilingual groups. \n\n### GAMM: Bilinguals and monolingual controls {#sec-all-groups-gamm}\n\n@tbl-group-gamm provides the model summary of the omnibus GAMM. \nIt portrays the same information provided in @fig-forest-plot-group-gamm-report, but it table format.\n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-group-gamm .cell tbl-cap='Group GAMM summary.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nEffect       Term                 Estimate              HDI   Rhat   Bulk ESS   Tail ESS\n-----------  ------------------  ---------  ---------------  -----  ---------  ---------\nPopulation   Intercept                0.60     [0.44, 0.76]   1.00     797.53    1436.65\n             HS                      −0.30   [−0.53, −0.11]   1.01     744.97    1223.82\n             L2                      −0.43   [−0.64, −0.23]   1.00     708.42     761.10\n             Oxytone                  0.06     [0.05, 0.08]   1.00    3429.99    3735.29\n             HS:Oxytone              −0.44   [−0.46, −0.42]   1.00    3469.26    3630.77\n             L2:Oxytone               0.00    [−0.02, 0.02]   1.00    3114.31    3926.50\n             Time                    −0.26   [−0.26, −0.26]   1.00    3581.16    3934.31\n             Time:Oxytone            −0.01   [−0.01, −0.01]   1.00    3865.39    3348.79\nGrouping     sd(Intercept)            0.45     [0.40, 0.51]   1.00    1088.45    1923.43\nSmooths      sds(Time)                0.03     [0.02, 0.06]   1.00    1620.98    2149.99\n             sds(Time:Oxytone)        0.02     [0.01, 0.04]   1.00    2522.74    3383.84\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n@tbl-group-gamm-prediction summarizes the probability of fixating on a target before actually hearing the target suffix. \nThese estimates were derived from the omnibus model described above. \nThe visual illustration of these results are provided in @fig-group-prediction-plot-report. \n\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-group-gamm-prediction .cell tbl-cap='Summary of target fixation estimates 200 ms after the target syllable offset.
